# Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset

## Overview

This dataset contains credit card transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013. The dataset presents a binary classification problem where the goal is to identify fraudulent transactions. Due to the highly imbalanced nature of the dataset, where fraudulent transactions account for only 0.172% of all transactions, specialized evaluation metrics are recommended.

## Dataset Summary

- **Total Transactions**: 284,807
- **Fraudulent Transactions**: 492
- **Class Distribution**:
  - **Non-fraudulent (Class 0)**: 284,315 (99.828%)
  - **Fraudulent (Class 1)**: 492 (0.172%)

## Features

The dataset includes 30 features:

- **V1 to V28**: These are the principal components obtained using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The original features have been transformed due to confidentiality reasons, so no further information about these components is available.
- **Time**: The number of seconds elapsed between this transaction and the first transaction in the dataset.
- **Amount**: The amount of the transaction. This feature can be useful for example-dependent cost-sensitive learning.
- **Class**: The target variable, where `1` indicates a fraudulent transaction, and `0` indicates a non-fraudulent transaction.

## Important Notes

1. **Class Imbalance**: The dataset is highly imbalanced, with the positive class (fraud) accounting for only 0.172% of the transactions. Due to this imbalance, traditional accuracy metrics like confusion matrix accuracy may not provide meaningful insights. Instead, we recommend evaluating models using the Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC).
  
2. **Feature Transformation**: All features except `Time` and `Amount` have been transformed using PCA to protect the confidentiality of the original data. As a result, no additional background information is available on the original features.

## Recommended Evaluation Metric

Given the severe class imbalance, the preferred metric for evaluating model performance is the **Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC)**. This metric focuses on the model's ability to correctly identify the positive class (fraudulent transactions), which is the primary concern in this context.
